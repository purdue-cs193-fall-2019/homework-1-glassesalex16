You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

- I really like how we are using GitHub, I knew it existed but never really got into using it
- I enjoy how the class is lead by other undergrad CS majors, it will be super helpful if I need help later in the semester
- Hopefully this class will introduce me to new friends and new opportunities and help me decide what I want to do in CS

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
